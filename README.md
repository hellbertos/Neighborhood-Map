# FEND Lesson 5: Neighborhood Map
## Fogbelt SF 
###A neighborhood map of the Ocean Beach area of San Francisco


This is my Udacity FEND Lesson 5 Final Project

This mini app offers a mini tour of my neighborhood and few of the cooler aspects of within using the google maps API. It offers up a small sampling of a few various points of interest, from shops to restaurants to points of interest. It offers a small taste of the beach neighborhoods in San Francisco. Click on any of the markers to get more information about that particular locale and a yelp suggestion about (other) places to eat in the area

Please download the repository and open the index.html file in a modern web browser, preferably the latest Google Chrome, to run this app.

### Thank You's
There are far too many resources for me to rewind to now, but Stack Overflow,"You are my friend". Udacity Discussion forums threads on the topic were very helpful as was rewatching a few videos as well as running back through some of the exercises.

I do recall a few specific "Shouts out":

* Andrew R - Udacity Forum Mentor - BIG UPS! to Andrew for all his help, insight and encouragement: particularly, [this thread](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/yelp-api-oauth-issue/40606/12).
* Anu Dhagat - Udacihome Leader - Thanks for sharing all your CS smarts Anu and helping all of us who journey down the peninsula during rush hour every Monday night. Your help getting my listing figured out was invaluable.
* All my Udacihome Study Buddies - For specific help on my issues as well as the opportunity to attempt to help you guys in return... not to mention just the motivation to face traffic to study w/ you gals n guys.
* These Posts on the forum:
  * Great info to get me going when my first submission was rejected for using Jquery to handle the "hambuger" menu functionality [Thread](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/click-binding-blocking-marker-clicks/35398).
  * And, the info I got here for helping me to try to make the mobile experience better (though I have some tweaks in mind as I keep working on this) [Thread](https://discussions.udacity.com/t/any-way-to-reduce-infowindow-content-on-mobile/40352/10)
* Did I mention Stack Overflow? And the folks asking and answering related questions on the interwebs at large.
