# Neighborhood-Map
FEND L5 Neighborhodd Map

This is my Udacity FEND Lesson 5 Final Project

This mini app offers a segment of my neighborhood and few of the cooler aspects of within; from shops to restaurants to points of interest.

Please download the repository and open the index.html file with a web browser, preferably Google Chrome, to run this app.
